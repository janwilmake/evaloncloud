I want a landingpage for my new product "Evalon". It's a cloud provider focused on the intelligent internet with agents with authentication and monetisation and supervision built-in.
Headline: Build agents for the intelligent internet
Make it super shiny and dark-theme with a half moon as logo, silver and black are the theme colours. font 'inter'
use cdn.tailwindcss.com script and vanilla HTML + JS
return me the full index.html
Please keep it simple; no scroll! VERY Large headline, apple swiss-style shine, and principles, and the CTA should be "Request Early Access" linking to /login
Put a half moon in the top right that kind of moves with the mouse position. ensure its all visible and ensure enough padding for everything.
